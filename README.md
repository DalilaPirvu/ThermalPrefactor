# ThermalPrefactor

In this project, we explore the numerical evolution of a classical real scalar field in (1 + 1) dimensions, starting with initial conditions that represent thermal fluctuations around a metastable vacuum.

We monitor the decay of the false vacuum in real time and measure several key observables: the shape of the critical bubble, the exponential suppression of the decay rate, and find coherent oscillonic precursors to critical bubble nucleation.

When comparing our results with the standard Euclidean formalism, we find that the decay rate prefactor is nearly an order of magnitude lower than predicted. This discrepancy, along with the presence of oscillons, are symptoms of non-equilibrium dynamics in simulations.

The data analysis is conducted using standard Python scripts and libraries.

The numerical tools we used to extract these observables from simulation ensembles are available in this repository.
